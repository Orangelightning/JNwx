    <h2>Area Forecasting Discussions</h2>

    <h3>AFD for West Lafayette, IN:
Date/Time: 2/3/2021 20:00 UTC-5</h3>
<h4>Synopsis:</h4>

High-pressure centered over our region will provide clear conditions as a frontal system will pass through the region tomorrow providing the chance for both rain and snow with some uncertainty in exact precipitation types. After the passage of the frontal system strong advection will persist in the region dramatically cooling temperatures well below average going into the weekend with much uncertainty in current model guidance. Potential snow events are possible according to the GFS going into the weekend and next week. Due to large snow-liquid ratios it is likely that even small amounts of precipitation could produce significant accumulations. 
<h4>Near Term (Today):</h4>

High-pressure will continue to dominate the region allowing for sinking motion to promote dry and clear conditions throughout the remainder of the day. Later portions of the day will have winds shift direction due to an incoming system bringing southerly flow later in the afternoon. This will not allow much cooling overnight with temperatures falling only into the upper 20s as cloudy conditions become more present as the night continues.

<h4>Short Term(Through Friday):</h4>

Much uncertainty remains in model guidance for precipitation types and the introduction of strong cold advection going into the Thursday timeframe. High confidence remains in the idea that southerly flow ahead of the frontal system approach our region will allow for above freezing temperatures which should make initial precipitation in our region rain. Uncertainty, particularly between the NAM and GFS, exists if strong cold advection will take place before the precipitation shield is able to exit the region. Another thing to mention is that the flow from the south ahead of the frontal system in the GFS is generally stronger due to larger and more consistent temperature advection at the 850mb level. As a result, it is uncertain whether rain will be the predominant precip type tomorrow or if a changeover to snow will occur as the system is exiting. It is important to note that the GFS has remained relatively stable in its prediction whereas the NAM has tended to shift towards this solution in the past few runs. Either way, both models regain a consensus as the system passes with strong cold advection and a sudden shift in wind direction out of the west bringing a large drop in temperatures and strong winds with it. Expect a rapid drop in temperatures over the course of Thursday night bottoming out in the low teens. Strong westerly flow will allow for conditions to clear out Friday and usher in very cold air with highs likely in the low to middle 20s. 

<h4>Long Term (Weekend & Next Week):</h4>

The pattern has officially changed going into the weekend starting with continued northwesterly flow keeping cold air in place throughout the day on Saturday. However, model guidance between the NAM and GFS are still uncertain as to how intense the cold air this weekend will be. The NAM tends to have a warmer solution than the GFS going into the weekend. When looking at the potential temperature difference between the NAM and the GFS the models have vastly different ideas of what the tropospheric height will look like going into the weekend. It appears that the NAM shows a southerly flow in the 850mb level that is simply not present in the GFS. The NAM could be picking up on the anticyclone being weaker and having less cold advection associated with it. Regardless, much uncertainty remains in the intensity of the cold air going into Saturday. Furthermore, the possibility exists for a system to move through the region going into Saturday night and Sunday. Model guidance has been all over the place with this system but the GFS hints at a possible quick moving low that could affect the region. It is important to note that snow-liquid ratios will likely be large. The GFS Kuchera method hinting at ratios possibly being on the order of 1:25 or greater. However, depending on if the NAM guidance holds these ratios may be smaller. Regardless, this means that any precipitation that approaches the region over the weekend will not require much precip amounts to produce significant snowfall accumulations. Going into next week GFS guidance suggests that this cold pattern will likely continue throughout the course of the week with potential dips in temperatures below the 0 degree mark at various points in the week. Long-term guidance to this extent is too uncertain to make any significant predictions with.
